#### Code example from codewars:
Task description: The makeLooper() function (make_looper in Python) takes a string (of non-zero length) as an argument. It returns a function. The function it returns will return successive characters of the string on successive invocations. It will start back at the beginning of the string once it reaches the end.
    function makeLooper(str) {
      let arr = [...str];
      return function looper(){
        if(arr.length > 0){
          return arr.shift();
        } else {
        arr = [...str];
        return looper();
        }
